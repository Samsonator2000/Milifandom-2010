      <h3>Constitution of the Monarchy<h3>

        <h4>ARTICLE 1:~Hierarchy</h4>
        
        <p>The Prince leads the Nobles, Knights and Peasants, and it is treason to disobey the Prince.
          <br><br>
        The nobles lead the knights and peasants. It is treason for a knight or peasant to disobey a noble.
        <br><br>
        The knights lead the peasants. It is treason for a peasant to disobey a knight.

        <h4>ARTICLE 2:~The Crown</h4>
        
        <p>The monarchy is a principality, ruled by the Prince, Kai Heartshorne.
          <br><br>
        The Prince owns all of the land of the nation.
        <br><br>
        The Prince has power over law and order, foreign relations and the distribution of wealth and land.
        <br><br>
        If the Prince marries, his spouse shall gain the title of Prince or Princess, and power shall be shared between the monarch and their spouse. The monarch may not marry below their class. 
        <br><br>
        If the Prince or Princess wishes to divorce, a licence for divorce must be granted by a unanimous vote of the priests of the Spiritual Community.
        <br><br>
        If the Prince abdicates the throne, the most senior noble must take his place. There must always be at least one noble in the principality, and the Prince may elevate a person of his choice to the nobility to ensure this.
