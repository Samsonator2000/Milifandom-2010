      <p>Constitution of the Democratic State


        ARTICLE 1:
        ~Parliament
        
        Parliament is formed of an upper and a lower house. All citizens of the Democratic State sit in the lower house, the House of Lords. The upper house, the House of the Lord, is formed of the 3 priests who lead the Spiritual Commune.
        
        New bills requires a majority in both houses before becoming law. New bills must first receive a majority in the House of Lords before reaching the House of the Lord. The House of the Lord may make any amendments to a new bill which they see fit, but any amendments must be voted on and receive a majority majority in the House of Lords. 
        
        An act of parliament, passed by a majority in both houses, is required to raise taxation. 
        
        Lords are obligated to declare a political affiliation, Priests are prohibited from any political affiliation.
        
        ARTICLE 2:
        ~The Prime Minister
        
        The Prime Minister is the lord who can command a majority of lords in the House of Lords, and is the leader of the Democratic State. The Prime Minister must confirm their support on the first day of each month through a vote of confidence. If the House of Lords has no confidence in the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister must resign and the post will remain vacant until there is another lord who commands the confidence of the House of Lords. 
        
        The Prime Minister is the only individual with the power to put legislation to parliament. 
        
        The Prime Minister has the power to form a cabinet, and can give cabinet ministers executive authority over:
        - Foreign Relations
        - Policing
        - Public Services
        - State Property
        - Trade
        - Currency
        - State Events
        - Official State Symbols
        
        The Prime Minister must select a deputy from their cabinet, who can oversee the function of government during an emergency in which the Prime Minister is unavailable.
        
        Any member of the House of Lords can call for a vote of no confidence, which upon receiving the support of the majority of the House of Lords, forces the resignation of the Prime Minister. 
        
        The Prime Minister can also resign of their own volition at any point.</p>
