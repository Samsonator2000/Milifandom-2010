      <h3>Constitution of the Spiritual Commune<h3>
        <h4>ARTICLE 1:~Clergy</h4>
        
        <p>citizens of the Commune are either monks or priests.
          <br><br>
        The Commune is led by 3 priests, the longest serving of which is the High Priest.
        <br><br>
        The High Priest is in charge of maintaining peace on the Holy Mountain.
        <br><br>
        The High Priest must appoint one priest to be the Grand Missionary, and represent the Spiritual Commune in foreign relations, and deliver the decision of the priests on international legislation.
        <br><br>
        The High Priest must appoint the other priest as Grand Defender, to lead the guard, and protect the Holy Mountain from foreign threats.
        </p>
        
        <h4>ARTICLE 2:~Sin</h4>
        
        <p>The three cardinal sins are as follows:<br>
        - Thou shalt not kill a living being upon the Holy Mountain, unless the blade is of gold.<br>
        - Thou shalt not kill a monk or priest who is in prayer.<br>
        - Thou shalt not burn the trees on the Holy Mountain.<br>
        <br><br>
        If a monk commits a sin, they must repent by throwing themselves from the mountain, and drowning themselves in the river.
        <br><br>
        If a priest commits a sin, they must forfeit their priesthood, and the High Priest will select a new priest.
        <br><br>
        New sins may be established, or disestablished, by a unanimous vote of the three priests. The three cardinal sins may not be altered</p>
